        "before_list": "The Victoria Hand Project (VHP) is a Canadian non-profit organisation founded in July 2015 in Victoria, British Columbia, with the goal of providing upper limb prosthetics to amputees in developing countries who have limited or no access to prosthetics. VHP has created the Victoria Hand System, a series of artificial limbs that enable amputees to perform household and work-related tasks and improve their quality of life.\n\nVHP's approach has three key features:\n\n",
        "first_item": "Establishment of a production centre and training of personnel who will be involved in the on-site production of 3D-printed prostheses in countries with low living standards.",
        "second_item": "Training and working with clinical and healthcare professionals to provide professional care for people with amputations.",
        "third_item": "Ongoing operations support for both the production centre and the clinical services network.\n\n",
        "after_list": "Receiving a prosthetic hand from VHP changes patients' lives. Functional prosthetic hands are an incredible tool that help amputees regain independence, hope and the ability to live a fuller and happier life.\n\nThe Victoria Hand project has now established partnerships in 12 countries - Canada, the United States, Nepal, Cambodia, Guatemala, Ecuador, Haiti, Egypt, Uganda, Kenya, Pakistan and, most recently, Ukraine. To date, more than 300 amputees worldwide have received Victoria Hand prostheses, and more than 50 clinicians have been trained in the use of this 3D technology.\n\nIn 2022, VHP identified a critical need for prosthetics for Ukrainian citizens who were injured during the ongoing war with the armed forces of the Russian Federation.\n\nIn 2022, the VHP team began raising funds to expand the project through the Hands for Ukraine initiative. Thanks to the donations received, in February 2023, VHP conducted a pilot project with two prosthetics clinics in Lviv and Vinnytsia, which included training doctors and prosthetics specialists and understanding the great need for care. After a successful fundraising effort, the VHP team returned to Ukraine in June 2023 to provide thorough training and finalise these partnerships, ensuring that the clinics can offer Victoria Hand prosthetics on a permanent basis. VHP has provided the necessary resources, including 3D printers, 3D scanners, computers, toolkits, materials and fasteners needed to make the prosthetic hands.\n\nIn October 2023, the Victoria Hand Project expanded its presence in Kyiv by launching a partnership with Invictus Medical Technologies Ukraine (IMTU) and the Kyiv State Experimental Prosthetic and Orthopaedic Enterprise."

      "technology_text": "3D printing allows for the printing of parts for prosthetic hands on demand locally in the country. 3D scanning is used to capture the unique shape of a person's limb, to 3D print and socket a limb that is fully customised for that user. Victoria's hand is a complete prosthetic system that includes a hand, wrist unit, special socket for the forearm and a harness to actuate the device. \n\nIn addition to plastic parts printed on a 3D printer, this system uses stainless steel components and fasteners to make the entire system stronger and more durable. As most of the prosthetic hand parts are standard, repair and maintenance is a fairly simple and straightforward process, which is another great advantage of the VHP system.\n\nVHP has the capabilities to fit transradial amputees (loss below the elbow), transhumeral amputees (loss above the elbow) and children with transradial loss. VHP has also taken over a US non-profit called LimbForge Technologies, which manufactures 3D printed cosmetic arms.",

        "eighth": "If desired, the hand can be painted with a skin-tone paint.",
        "ninth": "In case of repair or maintenance, all parts can be re-printed on a 3D printer, making this system very flexible, cost-effective and easy to maintain."

      "about_imtu_title": "About Invictus Medical Technologies Ukraine",
      "about_imtu_text": "Invictus Medical Technologies Ukraine, a private company, was founded in October 2023 by Mr Dmitriy Minenko, a Ukrainian-born but now Canadian citizen who is a permanent resident of Langley, British Columbia, where he has worked in the digital marketing industry for the past 22 years. \n\nMr Minenko has done extensive volunteer work supporting the Ukrainian Armed Forces since 2014, when the Crimean peninsula and parts of Eastern Ukraine were occupied by Russian forces. \n\nMr. Minenko helped the first group of Ukrainian veterans who lost limbs during the conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014-2015 and came to Canada to receive prosthetic assistance. He also participated in financial support for their families as part of the Maple Hope Canada Foundation initiative. \n\nIn 2022, Dmitriy Minenko began working with the Victoria Hand Project to help their team with travel plans to Ukraine and to organise training for Ukrainian doctors and prosthetics specialists and spread awareness of the technology. \n\nIn September 2023, Dmitriy travelled to Victoria for a week to receive training at the Victoria Hand Project's laboratory in the manufacture of prosthetic components using 3D printing technology, their assembly and maintenance. For a whole week, he worked with VHP staff, who taught him all the ins and outs of this business, which requires experience not only with 3D printers and 3D design software, but also with the careful assembly of mechanical prosthetic parts to make them functional, strong and durable.\n\nIn October 2023, after receiving his VHP certificate, Dmitriy Minenko travelled to Kyiv, Ukraine, and registered a private company, Invictus Medical Technologies Ukraine (IMTU), to launch the production of prosthetic hands using the 3D printing technology developed by the Victoria Hand Project. He brought in the first three 3D printers and one 3D scanner, tools, parts and materials needed for production, opened the IMTU office and provided training for a group of technicians. \n\nIMTU closely cooperates with the Research Institute of Advanced Defence Technologies (RIDT), which is based at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. One of the areas of work of this Institute is modern prosthetic technologies, and IMTU has established a formal partnership with NIADT to join forces to introduce and implement modern prosthetic technologies in Ukraine."
